I am a senior researcher at Samsung Research Brazil. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), Brazil. I have worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford (UK), the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin (Germany), and the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in Brazil. I have also been a visiting researcher at Northwestern University (USA), Humboldt University in Berlin, and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. My research includes data science, machine learning, and network science, mainly applied to climate science, geoinformatics, and computational social science.
