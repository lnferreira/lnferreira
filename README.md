I am a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford. I hold a Ph.D. in computer science and computational mathematics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), Brazil. I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin (Germany) and the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in Brazil. I also worked as a visiting researcher at Northwestern University (USA), Humboldt University of Berlin, and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. My research involves data science, machine learning, and network science, mainly applied to climate sciences, geoinformatics, and computational social sciences.
